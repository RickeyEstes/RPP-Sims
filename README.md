# RPP Simulations 

## Description: 

Simulating a new setup for efficient radioisotope positron propulsion, where the thrust the system can deliver increases with the number of available positron beams. This research proposes scattering two positron beams on each other. Then, using a uniform magnetic field, the scattered positrons can be clustered into groups, each of which can supply an independent positron beam. Essentially, two positron sources were used to produce many independent sources. These simulations were used to determine the magnitude of the field that produced the densest, or optimal cluster as a function of the scattered positrons' energy. They provided data on the position, momenta, and cluster time of the clustered positrons.  

# Requires:

A working installation of GEANT4PY (I found the G4PY configuration in Geant4.10.05.p01 to work the best)
